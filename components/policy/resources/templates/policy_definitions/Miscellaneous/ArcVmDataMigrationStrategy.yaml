caption: Migration strategy for ARC VM Data Migration
desc: |-
  Setting the policy specifies the action to take when the user's ARC data directory was created with virtio-fs. Unless virtio-fs data is migrated to virtio-blk, Android apps might run slower on ARC VM.

        Setting the policy to:

        * DoNotPrompt means do not ask the user to go through the migration flow. This is the default value when policy is unset.

        * Prompt (or an unsupported value) means that, at sign-in, user is prompted to go through the data migration flow. This can take up to 10 minutes.

        This policy only applies to ARM devices migrating to ARCVM.
