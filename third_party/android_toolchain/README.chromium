Description:
The Android NDK provides libraries and tools necessary for building, running,
and debugging C/C++ on Android. However, as Chromium builds it's own toolchain,
this directory only contains the simpleperf scripts and sysroot from the NDK.
This allows us to build and run tracing scripts and limits our dependencies.
