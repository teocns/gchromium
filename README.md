# Selective Proxy

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster,
and more stable way for all users to experience the web.

The project's web site is https://www.chromium.org.
The _"Selective Proxy"_ feature allows to proxy an intercepted request by passing the header `Stealthium-Proxy` to the requests' interception.

### Features
To check out the source code locally, don't use `git clone`! Instead,
follow [the instructions on how to get the code](docs/get_the_code.md).
It is implemented on branch [selective-proxy](https://github.com/teocns/gchromium/tree/selective-proxy), and was first presented with this [Pull Request](https://github.com/teocns/gchromium/pull/3). 

- [Selective Proxy](https://github.com/teocns/gchromium/tree/selective-proxy#readme)
Documentation in the source is rooted in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

- Fingerprinting
Learn how to [Get Around the Chromium Source Code Directory Structure
](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/getting-around-the-chrome-source-code).

For historical reasons, there are some small top level directories. Now the
guidance is that new top level directories are for product (e.g. Chrome,
Android WebView, Ash). Even if these products have multiple executables, the
code should be in subdirectories of the product.

#### Quick Start

```  
  proxy = 'http://user:password@host:port';

  await page.setRequestInterception(true);
  
  page.on('request', async (request) => {

    // Ensure that the request is a valid http scheme
    if (!request.url().startsWith('http')) {
      return request.continue();
    }
    
    // If this is a mime type that we don't want to proxy, continue
    const mime = request.resourceType();
    if (mime === 'image' || mime === 'media' || mime === 'font' || mime === 'stylesheet') {
      return request.continue();
    }
    
    console.warn(request.url())
    await request.continue({
      headers: {
        "Stealthium-Proxy": `https=${proxy};http=${proxy}`
      }
    });
  });  
```

The format follows that of the proxy parameter of [Chromium's network switches](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-settings/):


```--proxy-server=<scheme>=<uri>[:<port>][;...] | <uri>[:<port>] | "direct://"```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Providing only `http=` (without `https=`) will cause _https_ requests to perform *without* a proxy!
