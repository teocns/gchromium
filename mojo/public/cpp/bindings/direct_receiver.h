// DirectReceiver is a wrapper around the standard Receiver<T> type that always
// receives its messages directly from the sender without an IO-thread hop. To
// enable this safely DirectReceiver is constrained in a few ways:
//
//   - It cannot be unbound and moved once bound
//   - It's always bound on the current default task runner
//   - It must be bound on a thread which uses an IO MessagePump
//
// DirectReceiver works by creating and maintaining a separate ipcz node which
// is dedicated to the receiving endpoint and which receives I/O on its bound
// thread. This node is connected to the process's global ipcz node upon
// construction, and ipcz can then negotiate new direct connections between it
// and other nodes as needed.
//
// SUBTLE: DirectReceiver internally allocates a LIMITED SYSTEM RESOURCE on many
// systems (including Android and Chrome OS) and must therefore be used
// sparingly. All usage must be approved by Mojo OWNERS, with access controlled
// by the friend list in DirectReceiverKey above.
//
// EVEN MORE SUBTLE: Any Mojo interface endpoints received in messages to a
// DirectReceiver will also permanently receive I/O on the DirectReceiver's
// thread. While they may be bound on any thread and otherwise behave like any
// other Receiver, their incoming messages will hop through the DirectReceiver's
// thread just as messages to other Receivers normally hop through the global IO
// thread. Unless you're going to bind them all to the same thread as the
// DirectReceiver, passing pipes to your DirectReceiver is likely a BAD IDEA.
